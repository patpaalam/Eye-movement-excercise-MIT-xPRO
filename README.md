# Eye-movement-excercise-MIT-xPRO

In this Exercise we practiced how HTML, CSS, and Javascript work together. This module focused more on stylings with CSS and Bootstrap. 

In this exercise we manage to also incorporate DOM manipulation using event listeners (onmousemove). As you can see the eye balls move with the cursor.
